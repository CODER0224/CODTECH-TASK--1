 ## Overview of the Project

### Project Overview: Simple Calculator in Java

#### 1. Project Objective:
The goal of the project is to create a basic calculator application that can perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

#### 2. Key Features:
- **User Input**: The calculator takes two numbers as input from the user.
Arithmetic Operations: The calculator performs basic operations like:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (ร)
Division (รท)
- **Operator Input**: The user can select the operation they want to perform.
- **Result Display**: The result of the calculation is displayed to the user.

#### 3. Tools and Technologies:
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **IDE**: Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans (optional but recommended for ease of development)

#### 4.Libraries: Java Standard Libraries (java.util.Scanner for input, java.swing or java.awt for GUI, if applicable)

#### 5. Steps to Implement:
- **Setup**: Set up the development environment (IDE, project structure).
- **Design**: Plan the calculator's features and design the UI if using a GUI.
- **Implementation**: Write methods for each arithmetic operation.
Implement user input handling and validation.
Add code for displaying results.
- **Testing**: Test the calculator with different inputs to ensure it handles all cases correctly.
- **Enhancements (Optional)**: Add more advanced operations (e.g., square root, power).
Implement a memory function to store and recall values.
Improve the UI with additional features (e.g., clear button, error messages).
